# Block-Adblocker-blocker
A userscript to block 'Anti-Adblockers' on several Indian (especially news) websites that recently started blocking content for ad-block users, though they don't know a thing about non-intrusive advertising from any stretch of imagination. This script is just one of the possible solutions fo users who don't want to deal with the technical details. It currently works only in Firefox, or other browsers that support the HTML5 standard 'beforescriptexecute' event (Google Chrome doesn't). 

##Currently supported websites 
- [Times of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com)
- [Hindustan Times](http://hindustantimes.com)
- [NDTV](http://ndtv.com) 
- [anandabazar](http://anandabazar.com) 
- [Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com) 

##How to use (Only for Firefox)
- If you don't have it already, install the popular Firefox extension [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), and restart browser. 
- Install the script by clicking the hositng website's Install button or this link : [Block-Adblocker-blocker](https://github.com/piyushsoni/Block-Adblocker-blocker/raw/master/Block-Adblocker-blocker.user.js)
- Without a browser restart needed, you should be able to read the news on all of the currently supported websites (a page refresh might be required if already open)

##Can you add <xyz> site? 
Yes, I can definitely try. Just create an issue [here](https://github.com/piyushsoni/Block-Adblocker-blocker/issues) on github, and I will see if I can.
